		<div>Dear all,
			<span>I took this really cool course</span>
		</div>
		<span>on Coursera.org. I think it's my favorite course I've EVER taken! Here is the URL for it:</span>
		<a href="...">HTML, CSS and JS for Web Developers</a>
		<div>
			Does anyone know how I can give this course 6 out of 5 stars?
		</div>
		<div>
			Thank you, -Yaakov.... I mean a random student! Definitely not Yaakov.
